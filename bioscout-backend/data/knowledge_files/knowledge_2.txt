# Mammals of Islamabad

Islamabad and its surrounding areas, particularly the Margalla Hills National Park, support a diverse mammalian fauna. Approximately 38 species of mammals have been recorded in this region.

Large mammals include the Common Leopard (Panthera pardus), which is the apex predator in the ecosystem. Though rare, leopards are occasionally spotted in the upper reaches of Margalla Hills. Other notable large mammals include the Barking Deer (Muntiacus muntjak), Wild Boar (Sus scrofa), and Rhesus Macaque (Macaca mulatta).

Small mammals are abundant and include the Yellow-throated Marten (Martes flavigula), Small Indian Civet (Viverricula indica), Indian Pangolin (Manis crassicaudata), Porcupine (Hystrix indica), Fruit Bat (Pteropus giganteus), and various species of rats and mice.

The Indian Pangolin, found in Margalla Hills, is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List due to poaching for its scales and meat. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species.

The Smooth-coated Otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) can occasionally be spotted in Rawal Lake and its adjoining streams, though its population has declined due to habitat degradation.
