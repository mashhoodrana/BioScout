# Reptiles and Amphibians of Islamabad

Islamabad's diverse habitats support a range of reptilian and amphibian species. The region hosts approximately 13 reptile species and several amphibian species.

Common reptiles include the Indian Cobra (Naja naja), Common Krait (Bungarus caeruleus), Saw-scaled Viper (Echis carinatus), Checkered Keelback (Xenochrophis piscator), and Indian Monitor Lizard (Varanus bengalensis). The Bengal Monitor Lizard is frequently spotted in the Margalla Hills and Shakarparian areas.

The Indian Rock Python (Python molurus) is occasionally reported in the deeper valleys of Margalla Hills, though sightings are rare. This species is protected under Pakistani wildlife laws.

Among the smaller reptiles, various species of agamid lizards, skinks, and geckos are common. The Common Garden Lizard (Calotes versicolor) is abundant throughout the city's green spaces.

Amphibians in the region include the Skittering Frog (Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis), Indian Bull Frog (Hoplobatrachus tigerinus), and Common Toad (Duttaphrynus melanostictus). These are commonly found near water bodies like Rawal Lake and the various streams in Margalla Hills.

Conservation challenges for these species include habitat loss, road mortality, and persecution of snakes due to fear.
