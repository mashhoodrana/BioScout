# Plants of Islamabad

Islamabad has a rich diversity of plant species, both native and introduced. The region's vegetation varies from subtropical forests in Margalla Hills to scrub forests and grasslands in the lower plains.

Common tree species in Islamabad include Chir Pine (Pinus roxburghii), Blue Pine (Pinus wallichiana), and Himalayan Cedar (Cedrus deodara) at higher elevations. At lower elevations, common trees include Phulai (Acacia modesta), Shisham (Dalbergia sissoo), Siris (Albizia lebbeck), Wild Date Palm (Phoenix sylvestris), and Amaltas (Cassia fistula).

Flowering ornamentals widely planted throughout the city include Jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia), Bottle Brush (Callistemon citrinus), Silver Oak (Grevillea robusta), Paper Mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera), and various species of Ficus.

Native shrubs include Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana), Kau (Olea ferruginea), Phulai (Acacia modesta), and Sanatha (Dodonaea viscosa). Common herbs include Ajwain (Trachyspermum ammi), Mint (Mentha spp.), and various species of wild sage.

The city's parks and green belts showcase seasonal flowers such as roses, sunflowers, marigolds, dahlias, and numerous wildflower species that bloom after the monsoon rains.

Medicinal plants found in the area include Aloe Vera (Aloe barbadensis), Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum), Arjun (Terminalia arjuna), and Neem (Azadirachta indica), which have been traditionally used for various health conditions.

Conservation concerns include the spread of invasive species like Paper Mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera), which causes severe allergies among residents and displaces native vegetation.
